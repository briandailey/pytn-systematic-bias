					<aside class="notes">
                    This talk is mainly going over material from "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. I read the book about a year ago
                    and couldn't help but think about the ways that it applied to the software development profession.
                    Kahneman is a Professor at Princeton and did pioneering work in how we make decisions with Amos Tversky.
                    The book summarizes much of his research over his career along with other research in decision making.

                    Kahneman's underlying approach is to categorize the brain's activities into two systems: System 1 and System 2.

                        Let's talk about Kahneman's model for decision making.
                        This is the conscious decision making system. It is what most will
                        self-identify with as "you." It is your conscious thought.

                        Drives or confirms many of the decisions made by System 2.
                        According to Kahneman, this is where the interesting things
                        happen.

                        I won't spend a ton of time detailing the differences between
                        the two systems and how Kahneman arrived at this conclusion.
                        Read the book.
                        However, it's important to know that the decisions we make are
                        often driven by a subconscious engine. This often causes us
                        to make judgment errors based on weak evidence.

                    quickly, words that were related to the temperature (winter, ice,

                    His writing is rather dull and mechanical, occasionally enlivened
                    by somewhat corny puns and flashes of imagination of the sci-fi type.
                    He has a strong drive for competence. He seems to have little feel and
                    little sympathy for other people, and does not enjoy interacting
                    with others. Self-centered, he nonetheless has a deep moral sense.
